# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System Using python

You need to install different Python modules

<li>pip install dlib</li>
<li>pip install opencv-python
<li>pip install face-recognition
<li>pip install numpy</li>
<br>

The program has a 90+ plus percent Accuracy of Identifying and detecting faces and input it to the attendance.csv which you can open also in excel
this project is for education purposes only.

I recommend to use python version of 3.9.5 because I get some errors in installing different module if you used the new python version like 10+

Recommended IDE:

<li>Pycharm-Professional</li>
<li>Pycharm-Community</li>
